## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, I assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/ricitos2001/OMEGAI/blob/main/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/ricitos2001/OMEGAI/issues) that might help you. If you find a relevant issue but still need clarification, feel free to comment on it. Additionally, itâ€™s a good idea to search the web for answers before asking.

If you still need to ask a question, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/ricitos2001/OMEGAI/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (Python, OS, etc.), depending on what seems relevant.

I (or someone in the community) will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please investigate carefully, collect information, and describe the issue in detail in your report. Follow these steps to help us fix any potential bugs as quickly as possible:

- Ensure you are using the latest version.
- Verify that your issue is not due to misconfiguration or environmental issues. Make sure you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/ricitos2001/OMEGAI/blob/main/README.md).
- Check if the issue has already been reported by searching the [bug tracker](https://github.com/ricitos2001/OMEGAI/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Gather as much information as possible about the bug:
  - Stack trace (if applicable)
  - OS, platform, and version (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
  - Python version and any relevant package versions
  - Steps to reliably reproduce the issue

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> Do not report security-related issues, vulnerabilities, or bugs with sensitive information in public forums. Instead, report these issues privately by emailing hola_at_davidlms.com.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/ricitos2001/OMEGAI/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure yet if itâ€™s a bug, avoid labeling it as such until confirmed.)
- Explain the behavior you expected and what actually happened.
- Provide as much context as possible and describe the steps someone else can follow to recreate the issue. This usually includes a code snippet or an example project.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue. If the issue cannot be reproduced, the team will ask for more information and label the issue as `needs-repro`.
- If the issue is reproducible, it will be labeled `needs-fix` and potentially other relevant tags.
